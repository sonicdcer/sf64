# Starfox 64 (US) REV 1.1

This is a WIP **matching decompilation** of ***Starfox 64***. The purpose of the project is to recreate a source code base for the game from scratch, using information found inside the game along with static and/or dynamic analysis.

It currently builds the following ROM:

* starfox64.us.rev1.z64 `MD5: 741a94eee093c4c8684e66b89f8685e8`

**This repo does not include any assets or assembly code necessary for compiling the ROM. A prior copy of the game is required to extract the required assets.**

## Installation

#### 1. Install build dependencies

### Windows

For Windows 10, install WSL and a distribution by following this
[Windows Subsystem for Linux Installation Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).
We recommend using Debian or Ubuntu 22.04 Linux distributions.

### Linux (Native or under WSL / VM)

The build process has the following package requirements:

* make
* git
* build-essential
* binutils-mips-linux-gnu
* python3
* pip3
* libpng-dev

Under Debian / Ubuntu (which we recommend using), you can install them with the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install make cmake git build-essential binutils-mips-linux-gnu python3 python3-pip clang-format-14 clang-tidy
```

### MacOS

Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and the following dependencies:
```
brew update
brew install coreutils make pkg-config tehzz/n64-dev/mips64-elf-binutils
```

#### 2. Clone the repository

Create your own fork of the repository at `https://github.com/sonicdcer/sf64`. Then clone your fork where you wish to have the project, with the command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/sf64.git
```

This will copy the GitHub repository contents into a new folder in the current directory called `sf64`. Change into this directory before doing anything else:

```bash
cd sf64
```

#### 3. Install python dependencies

The build process has a few python packages required that are located in `/tools/requirements-python.txt`.

To install them simply run in a terminal:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r ./tools/requirements-python.txt
```
* Depending on your python version, you might need to add  --break-system-packages, or use venv.

#### 4. Update submodules & build toolchain

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
make toolchain
```

#### 5. Prepare a base ROM

Copy your ROM to the root of this new project directory, and rename the file of the baserom to reflect the version of ROM you are using. ex: `baserom.us.rev1.z64`
* Make sure the ROM is the US version, revision 1.1 (REV A).

#### 6. Make and Build the ROM

To start the extraction/build process, run the following command:

```bash
make init
```
This will create the build folders, a new folder with the assembly as well as containing the disassembly of nearly all the files containing code.

this make target will also build the ROM. If all goes well, a new ROM called "starfox64.us.z64" should be built and the following text should be printed:

```bash
741a94eee093c4c8684e66b89f8685e8  build/starfox64.us.rev1.z64
./build/starfox64.us.rev1.z64: OK
```

If you instead see the following:

```bash
./build/starfox64.us.rev1.z64: FAILED
md5sum: WARNING: 1 computed checksum did NOT match
```

This means that something is wrong with the ROM's contents. Either the base files are incorrect due to a bad ROM, or some of the code is not matching.

From now on you should be able to build the rom by running `make`.
